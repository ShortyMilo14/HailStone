Every positive integer has a related Hailstone sequence defined in the following way: starting with a positive integer n, the next term in the sequence is 3n+1 if n is odd or n/2 if n is even.
Repeating this process until you reach 1 yields the Hailstone sequence.

This short python application will calculate the hailstone sequence for any number. Enjoy!
